Game On! is an application composed of several microservices. The set services has changed over time: the best practice with microservice architectures is still to start with a monolith or (at least) very large chunks. We started with two large blobs, and refined the granularity of services as the application evolved. link:chronicles/README.md[The Chronicles] describe this evolution, if you're curious.

== Core Services

=== webapp

The webapp service is a simple nginx process that serves the static files that comprise the front-end of the UI. The front-end is a single page application written in JavaScript that makes requests using standard/published APIs to interact with backend microservices via the proxy/gateway. 

Having this as a separate entity allows our front-end to be changed and updated independently from other services. Some suggest that UI components should be provided by each backend service, which can be true with a UI built from distinct sections. The game, however, uses a more integrated UI: the application running in the client device is invoking public APIs directly, to render the responses appropriately. 

The webapp process has fairly simple scaling requirements, as it serving only cachable static files.

=== Mediator

Once upon a time, the mediator was part of the player service. It was split into its own microservice for two reasons: a) the function it performs is not strictly related to the notion of a "player", and b) it has drastically different scaling requirements because of what it does.

After a user has logged in, a websocket is established between the user's device and the mediator. The mediator then maintains a second websocket connection to whatever room the player is in. 

To provide the best user experience it can, the mediator retains cached information about rooms it has visited, to ensure that players can move between rooms if the map service can't be reached. It also provides a few special rooms itself: First Room, Empty Room, and Sick Room.

==== First Room

First Room is the starting place for every player joining the game, and is also where players return when things go terribly wrong, or when they call for a rescue (`/sos`). It also provides a few special commands that room implementors can use to teleport to rooms that they own.

==== Empty Room

==== Sick Room
