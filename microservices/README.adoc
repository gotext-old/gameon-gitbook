Game On! is an application composed of several microservices. The set services has changed over time: the best practice with microservice architectures is still to start with a monolith or (at least) very large chunks. We started with two large blobs, and refined the granularity of services as the application evolved. link:chronicles/README.md[The Chronicles] describe this evolution, if you're curious.
