Game On! is an application composed of several microservices.

Note that the set of core services has changed over time. The best practice with microservice architectures is still to start with a monolith, or at worst, with very large chunks. We started with two large blobs, and refined the granularity of services as the application evolved. link:chronicles/README.md[The Chronicles] describe this evolution, if you're curious.
