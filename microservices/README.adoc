Game On! is an application composed of several microservices. The set services has changed over time: the best practice with microservice architectures is still to start with a monolith or (at least) very large chunks. We started with two large blobs, and refined the granularity of services as the application evolved. link:chronicles/README.md[The Chronicles] describe this evolution, if you're curious.

=== webapp

The webapp service is trivial: it is a simple nginx process that serves the static files that comprise the front-end of the UI. The front-end uses standard/published APIs to interact with backend microservices. Having this as a separate service allows our front-end to be changed and updated independently of the other services. This service has fairly simple scaling requirements, as it serving only cachable static files.
