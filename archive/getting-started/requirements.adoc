== Java

The java-based services require Java 1.8, and are built on the Liberty runtime. Any compliant JVM should work. We use both IBM and Oracle JVMs.

* {oracledownload}[Download] the JDK from Oracle. Be sure to accept the license agreement.

* {ibmdownload}[Download] the JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i), or {liberty}[Download] a Liberty package that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

== JavaScript

Both front and backend services that use JavaScript will {nodejsdownload}[require node.js]. Use the latest from the long term service (LTS) stream.
