== Using Docker

We require docker-compose version 1.5.0 or greater.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Installing Docker] varies by platform. For https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/[Mac] and https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/[Windows], Docker Toolbox (referenced below) has superceded Boot2Docker.

There is a conceptual difference between what happens on linux vs. on Windows or Mac that could use some explaining: 

* When you run on linux, the "host" for your containers is the OS itself, so 127.0.0.1 will work just fine.
* When you run on Mac or Windows, there is a VirtualMachine acting as the host for your containers. This means that (for URLs and other things) you need to use the xref:dockerhost[IP of the host]. 


== Docker Toolbox (Mac and Windows)

https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox[Docker Toolbox] allows you to run a Docker host in a
virtual machine that will run inside your laptop/desktop.

Download Docker Toolbox for your operating system and run through the installer.

When the installation completes, select `Docker QuickStart Terminal` in the window that pops up
to get started using your local VM that  will function as your Docker host.

You should see something like the following in the terminal that comes up:

----
Creating Machine default...
Creating CA: /Users/programsam/.docker/machine/certs/ca.pem
Creating client certificate: /Users/programsam/.docker/machine/certs/cert.pem
Creating VirtualBox VM...
Creating SSH key...
Starting VirtualBox VM...
Starting VM...
----

[CAUTION]
The first time you run this process, it can take some time to start the VM.  Be patient.

When the installer is finished, you should see something like this:

----
                        ##         .
                  ## ## ##        ==
               ## ## ## ## ##    ===
           /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
           \______ o           __/
             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/

  docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100
  For help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com
----

*Take special note of the IP address that is similar to my example of `192.168.99.100`.*
This is your Docker host, and any containers you run on Docker will be accessible from
this IP if you have mapped their ports.

At the prompt, type

  $ docker run hello-world

To test that Docker installed correctly.  You should see something like the following:

----
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

  b901d36b6f2f: Pull complete
  0a6ba66e537a: Pull complete
  Digest: sha256:517f03be3f8169d84711c9ffb2b3235a4d27c1eb4ad147f6248c8040adb93113
  Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

  Hello from Docker.
  This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
  To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
   1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
   2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
   3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
   4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

  To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:

  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

[[dockerhost]]
== Determining the host IP address

After you have Docker Toolbox installed, verify the host machine name: 
`docker-machine ls`. The default name is `default`, but if you're a former Boot2Docker user, it may be `dev` instead. Substitute this value appropriately in what follows.

If you aren't using the docker quick-start terminal, you'll need to set the docker environment variables in your command shell using `eval "$(docker-machine env default)"`.

Get the IP address for your host using `docker-machine ip default`.
