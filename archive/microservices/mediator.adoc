Code

*Written In/Based On*: IBM WebSphere Liberty

The mediator service allows multiplex communication over secure WebSockets between the Game On! Web app and the Game On! Rooms.

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The mediator service utilizes the following environment variables:

* *LICENSE*: Required by the https://hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/[IBM WebSphere Liberty Docker Image], set this environment variable to `accept` to demonstrate that you accept the Liberty and IBM JDK licenses.
* *CONCIERGE_URL*: The full URL to the concierge microservice (e.g. `https://gameontext.org/concierge`).
* *CONCIERGE_KEY*: A secret key, shared between player service and concierge that authenticates player to query concierge about room information.
* *PLAYER_URL*: The full URL to the player microservice (e.g. `https://gameontext.org/play/players`).

* *ETCDCTL_ENDPOINT* (optional): The http-accessible endpoint for an etcd member with configuration for Game On! services. See link:./using_etcd.adoc[using etcd] for more information.


## Prereq

* gradle v2.7

## Build & development

Run live in WDT
Run `gradle build` to build the final server package for deployment.

## Testing

Gradle integration should mean running e2e tests for JS and Java app in one go (not there yet)

## Docker

To build a Docker image for this app/service, execute the following:

```
gradle buildImage
```

Or, if you don't have gradle, then:

```
./gradlew buildImage
```

### Interactive Run

```
docker run -it -p 9443:9443 --env-file=./dockerrc --name gameon-mediator gameon-mediator bash
```

Then, you can start the server with
```
/opt/ibm/wlp/bin/server run defaultServer
```

### Daemon Run

```
docker run -d -p 9443:9443 --env-file=./dockerrc --name gameon-mediator gameon-mediator
```

### Stop

```
docker stop gameon-mediator ; docker rm gameon-mediator
```

### Restart Daemon

```
docker stop gameon-mediator ; docker rm gameon-mediator; docker run -d -p 9443:9443 --env-file=./dockerrc --name gameon-mediator gameon-mediator
```
