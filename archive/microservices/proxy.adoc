Code

*Written In/Based On*: HAProxy

The proxy service allows for load balancing and highly available deployment of the Game On! services.

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The proxy service utilizes the following environment variables:

 * *ADMIN_PASSWORD*: The password for `admin` that allows access to the HAProxy statistics page.
 * *ETCDCTL_ENDPOINT* (optional): The http-accessible endpoint for an etcd member with configuration for Game On! services. See link:./using_etcd.adoc[using etcd] for more information.

## Useful Docker Examples

*Build*:
```
docker build -t gameon-proxy .
```
*Stop*
```
docker stop -t 0 gameon-proxy ; docker rm gameon-proxy
```

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 1936:1936 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --name=gameon-proxy gameon-proxy
```

*Restart*
```
docker stop -t 0 gameon-proxy ; docker rm gameon-proxy ; docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 1936:1936 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --name=gameon-proxy gameon-proxy
