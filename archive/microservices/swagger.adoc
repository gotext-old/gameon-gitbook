*Written In/Based On*: swagger and nginx

The Swagger service provides a hosted Swagger UI endpoint that shows the API contracts for Game On! services, allowing developers
to interact with those services individually to see how to augment or integrate with the Game On! system.

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The swagger service utilizes the following environment variables:

* *ETCDCTL_ENDPOINT* (optional): The http-accessible endpoint for an etcd member with configuration for Game On! services. See link:./using_etcd.adoc[using etcd] for more information.

This project contains the Game On! APIs documented in Swagger.
