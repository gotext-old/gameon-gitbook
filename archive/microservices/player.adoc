Code

*Written In/Based On*: IBM WebSphere Liberty

The Player service is responsible for authenticating and registering players, and identifying those players to other
services within Game On!

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The player service utilizes the following environment variables:

* *LICENSE*: Required by the https://hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/[IBM WebSphere Liberty Docker Image], set this environment variable to `accept` to demonstrate that you accept the Liberty and IBM JDK licenses. 

 * *CONCIERGE_URL*: The full URL to the concierge microservice (e.g. `https://game-on.org/concierge`). 
 * *SUCCESS_CALLBACK*: The full URL to redirect users to after successful OAuth2 authentication with one of the social networking sites (e.g. `https://game-on.org/#/login/callback/`).
 * *PLAYER_URL*: The full URL to the player microservice (e.g. `https://game-on.org/play/players`).
 * *CONCIERGE_KEY*: A secret key, shared between player service and concierge that authenticates player to query concierge about room information.
 * *MONGO_HOST*: IP Address or Hostname of a mongoDB host that player service can use to persist its information about players who have logged in to Game On!
 * *MONGO_PORT*: Same as above, only this is the port number that mongoDB listens on.
 * *TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY*: Application ID/key for consuming OAuth2 authentication for twitter. See link:https://apps.twitter.com/[Twitter's Developer Pages] for more information.
 * *TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET*: Secret from Twitter for utilizing the above ID to authenticate users in Game On!
 * *FACEBOOK_APP_ID*: Application ID/key for consuming OAuth2 authentication for Facebook.  See link:https://developers.facebook.com/products/login[Facebook's Developer Page] for more information.
 * *FACEBOOK_APPP_SECRET*: Secret from Facebook for utilizing the above ID to authenticate users in Game On!
 * *GOOGLE_APP_ID*: Application ID/key for consuming OAuth2 authentication for Google.  See link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent[Google's Developer Pages] for more information.
 * *GOOGLE_APP_SECRET*: Secret from Google for utilizing the above ID to authenticate users in Game On!
 
 
 * *ETCDCTL_ENDPOINT* (optional): The http-accessible endpoint for an etcd member with configuration for Game On! services. See link:./using_etcd.adoc[using etcd] for more information.

## Prereq

* gradle v2.7

## Build & development

Run live in WDT
Run `gradle build` to build the final server package for deployment.

## Testing

Gradle integration should mean running e2e tests for JS and Java app in one go (not there yet)

## Docker

To build a Docker image for this app/service, execute the following:

```
gradle buildImage
```

Or, if you don't have gradle, then:

```
./gradlew buildImage
```

### Interactive Run

```
docker run -it -p 9443:9443 --env-file=./dockerrc --name gameon-player gameon-player bash
```

Then, you can start the server with 
```
/opt/ibm/wlp/bin/server run defaultServer
```

### Daemon Run

```
docker run -d -p 9443:9443 --env-file=./dockerrc --name gameon-player gameon-player
```

### Stop

```
docker stop gameon-player ; docker rm gameon-player
```

### Restart Daemon

```
docker stop gameon-player ; docker rm gameon-player; docker run -d -p 9443:9443 --env-file=./dockerrc --name gameon-player gameon-player
```
