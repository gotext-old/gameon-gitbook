Code

*Written In/Based On*: IBM WebSphere Liberty

The Concierge service is responsible for tracking the rooms in the Game On! world, their connections "geographically" to one another. 
Concierge also provides information to the web app and user about those rooms and how to connect and interact with them over web sockets.

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The concierge service utilizes the following environment variables:

* *LICENSE*: Required by the https://hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/[IBM WebSphere Liberty Docker Image], set this environment variable to `accept` to demonstrate that you accept the Liberty and IBM JDK licenses.
* *REGISTRATION_SECRET*: A secret key shared between concierge and services who are allowed to register rooms (such as link:../microservices/room.adoc[Room Service], and link:../microservices/room-nodejs.adoc[Room Node.js Service]). Set this value in concierge and then use it in other services.
* *QUERY_SECRET*: A secret key shared between concierge and services who query concierge for information about rooms (such as link:../microservices/player.adoc[Player Service]).

* *ETCDCTL_ENDPOINT* (optional): The http-accessible endpoint for an etcd member with configuration for Game On! services. See link:../about/using_etcd.adoc[using etcd] for more information.

This is a service to manage the various rooms available in a game.
