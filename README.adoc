https://game-on.org/[Game On!] is a throwback text-based adventure built to
help you explore microservice architectures and related concepts.

It can be difficult to get a full picture of what a microservices
application should look like, or to understand why it is said that
microservice architectures both remove and introduce complexity
at the same time.

There are a few reasons why we love this application:

It demonstrates the key aspects of microservice architectures::
It is composed of a {microservices}[slew of core and secondary services] which
have their own scaling requirements, their own data sources, and are built,
deployed, and managed autonomously via automated pipelines.

It has an {chronicles}[informative origin story]::
The services that comprise the game have changed over time. We started with a
few coarse services, and revised and decomposed these as our early ideas
solidified into distinct units.

It is infinitely extensible in a creative and fun way.::
We know, this doesn't feel very business-y. But we've found that people are less
likely to take risks in trying new technologies when they have their serious
business hats on. That, and firm associations with existing applications can
anchor thinking to traditional approaches. Anchored thinking causes problems when trying 
to understand how you might design a microservice around a business function or
domain instead of around a data model.
