Over time, the Player service, which was filling multiple roles, felt more and
more out of place. It was already cut down once, when we moved the webapp out,
but the mediator function was very complex, and will have different load/scaling
requirements at the end of the day.

* The Player service (even if we keep the auth and player datastore together) is
REST-only, which has fairly well understood load/scaling characteristics.
* The mediator function, on the other hand, is managing approximately two WebSocket
connections per connected user. Data will be flowing through the mediator in a
much different way.

Lots of reasons.

We did finally split the two functions apart, which was not difficult. They were
independent of each other, but happened to be built/packaged together in the same
app from within the same project. It was almost like we knew we would have to do
this when we started...
