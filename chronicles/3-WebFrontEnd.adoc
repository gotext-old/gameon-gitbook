There is no good reason (and many not-good reasons) to have your web front end
packed in with a Java application. Freeing your front-end developers to be able
to develop and test without worrying about the Java gorp is a good thing.

We therefore split the web stuff into its own (small, simple) container. This had
the added 'bonus' of requiring CORS headers for local development, which was a
pain. In production, the proxy alleviated these issues: all of the services
belonged to the same domain.

This could be countered using xip.io, but for that to work, you still need to be
connected to the internet to allow the xio.io domain to resolve.

We added CORS filters to the app for the time being and moved on.
