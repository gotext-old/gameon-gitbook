An item long on our wishlist was to stop having hardcoded endpoint urls
(passed in as environment variables) for our services. We know it isn't nice,
and it makes it harder to scale service instances without adding intermediate
proxies all over the place.

We're using {amalgam8}[Amalgam8] (A8) for it's service discovery and service
proxying abilities. Amalgam8 uses sidecars to manage service registration
and discovery. Programmable load balancing and routing is provided via an in-container
outbound proxy to other services. This simplifies how much our services
have to deal with.

In effect, our services are still using fixed URLs passed in
via the environment, but the A8 sidecar is translating that fixed URL into a
point to point connection with the target remote service. When Mediator wishes to
talk to Map to discover which room is behind an Exit, it no longer talks to a
fixed remote endpoint configured via etcd, but instead talks to its
in-container proxy, asking for the Map service via a known local url.
A8 then handles connecting the request to the correct service instance running in
another container.
