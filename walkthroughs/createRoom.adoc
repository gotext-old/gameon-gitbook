This game was built to give you reasons to try things, to make it easier (or
more interesting) for you to learn the hard way.

Creating a simple microservice that provides a room can take as little as 15
minutes. A simple service must provide a publicly reachable WebSocket endpoint
that satisfies the {WebSocket}[WebSocket protocol], and that's it for a basic,
functional room.

== Why are there WebSockets again?

_I thought microservices were about REST!_

Asynchronous interaction patterns are an important part of microservice
architectures. In our case, WebSockets are a stand-in for messaging protocols
like MQTT that could be used, but that require much more coordination and setup
between parties that don't know each other all that well (i.e. us and you, the
intrepid room writer).

== Visits from the Sweep

Registered rooms are visited periodically by {sweep}[the Sweep].
The Sweep will score rooms based on on availability, and adherence
to the Room API (primarily the {WebSocket}[WebSocket protocol]), as well as
other factors like unique room names and descriptions, or the presence of
customized items or commands.

Rooms will move in the map based on their score, with high-scoring
rooms moving toward the center (closer to First Room), and low-scoring
rooms moving toward the periphery.

== Let's get started!

As mentioned above, creating a room (your very own microservice) is straight-up.
Your deployment options may vary depending on the language you choose.

* {javascript}[Create a Game On! Room in JavaScript]
* {java}[Create a Game On! Room in Java]
* {go}[Create a Game On! Room in Go]
* {samples}[... browse for sample rooms in other languages]

Once you have a sample room created and {deployRoom}[deployed], you'll
{registerRoom}[register] the room's WebSocket endpoint with the game
(essentially a webhook).
