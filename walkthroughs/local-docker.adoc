== Requirements

* `docker-compose` {releases}[version 1.15.0 or greater].
{compose}[Installation instructions] vary by platform.

[[running]]
== Starting game services locally

1. Obtain the source for the root project ({root}[gameontext/gameon])
  * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/gameontext/gameon.git`
  * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:gameontext/gameon.git`

2. Change to the gameon directory
+
-------------------------------------------
$ cd gameon
-------------------------------------------
3. Setup your environment (one time, see <<go-run,below>>).
+
-------------------------------------------
$ ./go-admin.sh choose       # choose Docker Compose
$ eval $(./go-admin.sh env)  # set aliases for admin scripts
$ alias go-run               # confirm `docker/go-run.sh`
-------------------------------------------
4. Set up core game services (repeatable):
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run setup
-------------------------------------------
+
This will ensure that you have an env file suitable for use
with `docker-compose` and pulls the initial images required
for running the system.
+
When using Vagrant, this step is done as part of provisioning the VM.

5. Start core game services:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run up
-------------------------------------------
5. Wait for the system warm up
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run wait
-------------------------------------------
or, to watch the logs stream by, try:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run logs
-------------------------------------------

7. *Carry on with {adventures}[building your room]!*

8. Clean up
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run down
-------------------------------------------


== Files supporting Docker Compose

The `docker` subdirectory of the root project
contains the files required to make game services go:

* `docker-compose.yml` declares core game and required backing services
* `docker-compose.override.yml.example` can be copied to `docker-compose.override.yml`
  and modified to support overlays for local development
* `go-run.sh` helps with starting, stopping, and cleaning up Game On! core services.
* `docker-functions` is used by `go-run.sh` to generate the keystore volume
   and perform docker-specific, environment-appropriate commands.

== Configuration

When Game On! runs in the cloud, it uses etcd to obtain its configuration.
When running locally it expects all this to be fed to it via the environment.
The `gameon.env` file defined in the docker directory provides this local
configuration for Docker Compose.

Some additional notes regarding environment-specific config:

* When you run natively, the "host" for your containers is the OS itself, so
  127.0.0.1 will work just fine (default url in `gameon.env`).

* When you run in Docker Toolbox, there is a VirtualMachine acting as the host
  for your containers. This means that (for URLs and other things) you need to
  use the xref:dockerhost[IP of the VM]. A `gameon.<DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME>env`
  file will be created as a modified copy of `gameon.env` to adjust.

* Similarly, if you are running with Vagrant, you need to use the Vagrant VM's
  IP address. A `gameon.vagrantenv` file will be created in the docker directory
  as a modified copy of `gameon.env`.

== SSH Keys and KeyStores

Because Game On! uses a Certificate for HTTPS and for JWT signing, we need to
generate one for local use. We create a special mapped volume (called `keystore`)
that provides a generated local keystore to containers.

Scripts will ensure that this volume exists.

[[go-run]]
[NOTE]
.About `go-run.sh`, `go-run`, and `go-compose`:
====
- Use `eval $(./docker/go-run.sh env)` to add `go-run` and `go-compose` aliases
  to your shell:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ eval $(./docker/go-run.sh env)
$ alias
-------------------------------------------

- Use `go-run` without arguments to get a list of available actions. Some examples
  based on the alias created above:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run up
$ go-run down
$ go-run logs
$ go-run rebuild
$ go-run restart
$ go-run wait
-------------------------------------------

- `go-compose` wraps the invocation of `docker-compose` with `-f` options for
`docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` (if present), and
`sudo` (if required).
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-compose ps
$ go-compose logs
-------------------------------------------

====

Additional notes when running with Docker Compose:

* `docker-compose` still requires sudo on linux platforms, even
though `docker` doesn't.
* The Vagrant VM allows all `sudo` operations with no password.

[[rebuild]]
== Rebuilding Core Game services with Docker Compose

The following instructions assume you've cloned the root repository,
and are interested in editing the `map` service as an example:

1. Change to the gameon directory
+
-------------------------------------------
$ cd gameon
-------------------------------------------
2. Obtain the source for the project that you want to change.
+
-------------------------------------------
$ git submodule init map
$ git submodule update map
-------------------------------------------
3. Make your changes from within the child directory
+
-------------------------------------------
$ cd map
$ git checkout -b newbranch
-------------------------------------------
Edit source or docker/image files using your favorite IDE.
+
TIP: If you plan to edit projects with Eclipse, run `./bin/eclipse.sh` to generate eclipse project files.

4. Compile the source and rebuild docker image
* To rebuild and restart the map service:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run rebuild map
-------------------------------------------
* To rebuild the image without recreating the container:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ go-run rebuild_only map
-------------------------------------------
* If the service argument is left off, it will attempt to rebuild all
of the core services (auth, map, mediator, player, room, webapp). If those
submodules haven't been checked out, there is no harm. The image from dockerhub
will be used instead.
+
[NOTE]
.Top-down vs. incremental updates
====
If you want to try using incremental publish, where your changes are live inside
the container without requiring the container to be stopped, started, rebuilt
or otherwise messed with, you'll need to create and/or add some lines
to `./docker/docker-compose.override.yml` to create overlay volumes.

`./docker/docker-compose.override.yml.example` provides examples of how
to map expected github subrepository paths to volumes. Copy snippets from
that file for the services you're interested in into `docker-compose.override.yml`.

`./docker/go-run.sh` will accommodate the creation of the `docker-compose.override.yml`
file, but you may need to run `eval $(./docker/go-run.sh env)` to update your
aliases.
====

5. Push your changes to a new branch. From the map directory:
+
-------------------------------------------
$ git add -u
$ git commit -s
-------------------------------------------
[NOTE]
====
Git commits must be {contribute}[signed]
====
Once you make your commit, if you go back to the root directory, you will see
a pending change for map. This indicates that the submodule is different than
the version from the current branch of the root project.

*Do not check in changes to submodule versions*
+
Care must be taken to avoid staging these files if you otherwise end up making
changes to files in the root project itself.

==== Iterative development of Java applications with WDT

If you're using Eclipse for development, and have opted for the iterative
approach (using `docker-compose.override.yml` for volumes, e.g.),
we recommend using WebSphere Developer Tools (WDT) to work with the Java
services contained in the sample. There is some (one time) {wdt-eclipse}[configuration
required to make WDT happy with the docker-hosted applications],
but you are then free to use eclipse to make changes to the project that will
be immediately picked up by the running server without having to rebuild
or restart anything.

[[dockerhost]]
=== Determining the host IP address (Docker Toolbox)

After you have Docker Toolbox installed, verify the host machine name:
`docker-machine ls`. The default name is `default`, but if you're a former
Boot2Docker user, it may be `dev` instead. Substitute this value appropriately
in what follows.

If you aren't using the docker quick-start terminal, you'll need to set the
docker environment variables in your command shell using
`eval "$(docker-machine env default)"`.

Get the IP address for your host using `docker-machine ip default`.

`./docker/go-setup.sh` and `./docker/go-run.sh` will create a
`gameon.<DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME>env` file to account for the IP address
difference.
