Your room needs a publicly reachable endpoint for people to visit it.
This could mean running your room as a traditional server on any old hosting
service. But as we're playing with cloud native applications and microservices,
we should try deploying our service to a Cloud provider.

.IBM Bluemix
* {cf}[Deploy your room as a Cloud Foundry application]
* {docker}[Deploy your room as a Docker Container]

.Heroku
* {heroku}[Deploy your room as a Heroku application]

== Find your public endpoint

To {register}[register your room], you will need the public WebSocket endpoint.
You can find the WebSocket endpoint, a health check URL, and a
primitive WebSocket protocol tester on the application's index page.

Your service URL will vary depending on where you have deployed your service, but
it should look something like:

.IBM Bluemix
* Cloud Foundry application or Container group in IBM Container Service:
  - US South: `http://<cf-app-name>.mybluemix.net/`
  - United Kingdom: `http://<cf-app-name>.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/`
* Single container instance in IBM Container Service
  - `http://<ip address>:9080/`

.Heroku
* `http://<noun-noun-number>.herokuapp.com/`
