== Prerequisites for Bluemix deployment

- https://console.ng.bluemix.net[Bluemix account] / https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/admin/account.html[Signing up for Bluemix]
- https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/[Cloud Foundry command line]
- https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_cli_cfic_install.html[Install the IBM Containers plugin]

[NOTE]
.Some notes about your Bluemix account
====
After you've logged into Bluemix on the web, your active region,
organization, and space are shown in the top right-hand corner.
You'll need these three values in the following steps.

See the https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/admin/orgs_spaces.html[Bluemix
documentation] for more information on Bluemix organizations and spaces.

== Log in using the `cf` command

See the {cficDoc}[IBM Bluemix Container Service plug-in] documentation
for the latest instructions, what follows is the TL;DR version:

1. Login to Bluemix via the command line:
+
    cf login
+
  - Enter Bluemix API endpoint (for your region):
    * US South: `https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
    * London: `https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net`
    * Sydney: `https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net`
  - Enter email and password for Bluemix login
    * If logging in with a federated ID (if you don't know what this means,
      you aren't), use the `-sso` option with a
      https://login.ng.bluemix.net/UAALoginServerWAR/passcode[one-time use password]
  - Choose a Bluemix organization by number
  - Choose a Bluemix space by number

2. If this is your first time logging in to Bluemix, or using the IBM
Container service, create a namespace. _This step happens only once, and
can't be changed, so choose well._
+
    cf ic namespace set <my_namespace>
+
    - Use only letters, numbers, or underscores
    - Use 4 to 30 characters

3. Initialize required keys and certificates for the Bluemix docker image registry:
+
    cf ic init

== Add the docker image to the IBM Container service registry

1. Use `cf ic` commands to build the docker container and push it into the Bluemix registry.
   Use the `-t <tagName>` option to tag the image.
  - For the `sample-room-java` project, from the application root directory:

    cf ic build -t gojava .

2. Verify that your image is in the Bluemix registry:
+
    cf ic images

See the Bluemix documentation for more information about
https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_images_pulling.html[pushing local images to the Bluemix Registry].

== Deploy a single container

1. Start the container by running the command `cf ic run`. You can find the full path to the image
   from the output of `cf ic images`.
  - For the `sample-room-java` project, as an example:
+
    cf ic run -p 9080 --name gojava registry.ng.bluemix.net/<your-org>/gojava

2. Bind a public IP address to your container
   - Get a public IP address
+
    cf ic ip request
+
   - Bind it to your running container:
+
    cf ic ip bind <ip address> <tagName>

3. Check the status of your container
+
    cf ic ps
+
Wait for it to switch from "Networking" to "Running"

4. Use the public IP address to visit your running container
  - For the `sample-room-java` project, use `http://<ip-address>:9080/`.
  - Copy the websocket endpoint address. Use this address in your {roomRegistration}[room registration].

== Deploy as a container group

Instead of deploying a container as a single instance, you can instead deploy a
container group. A container group load balances between multiple instances of
the same container.

1. Create the container group:
+
    cf ic group create -p 9080 -n <appName> --name <groupName> <registry>/<namespace>/<tagName>
+
You can find the full path to the image from the output of `cf ic images`.

  - For the `sample-room-java` project, an example would be:
+
    cf ic group create -p 9080 --name gojavagroup registry.ng.bluemix.net/<org-name>/gojava

2. Make sure your group has been created:
+
    cf ic group list
+
"CREATE_COMPLETE" means the group has been created.

3. Define a route to make your containers publicly available at <appHost>.mybluemix.net:
+
    cf ic route map -n <appHost> -d mybluemix.net <groupName>

4. Check the status of your instances
+
   cf ic group instances <groupName>
+
Once they are in "Running" state your group is ready to use.

5. Go to `http://<appHost>.mybluemix.net` to access your application.
  - Copy the websocket endpoint address. Use this address in your {roomRegistration}[room registration].
