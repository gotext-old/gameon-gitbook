Game On! is relies on a variant of a WebHook to allow the core game to find your
service. Part of registering a room is providing a publicly reachable endpoint
(a WebHook) that follows the Room API (primarily the
{WebSocket}[WebSocket protocol]), as well as other factors like unique room
names and descriptions, or the presence of customized items or commands.

[NOTE]
====
Room registration is long-lived: the registration for your room
will persist until you delete it. You can list and delete your registered
rooms using commands in {first-room}[First Room] or the Room Management
page.

== Room Management: Create a new room

1.  Go to https://game-on.org[Game On!] and sign in.
2.  Click on the [room-edit]#building icon# in the top right of the game screen
    to go to the Room Management page.
3.  Make sure **Create a new room** is selected from the **Select a room** drop-down.
4.  Provide a short nickname for your room (required), e.g. `shortcut`
5.  Provide a descriptive title for your room, e.g. `The Shortest Cut`
6.  Paste in the WebSocket endpoint.
    If you visit your deployed application, you should be able to copy the
    WebSocket address from the (admittedly basic) webpage.
7.  Fill in as many other fields as you care to.
    * The description provided in this UI is used in the interactive map and
      other lists or indexes of defined rooms. The description shown in the
      game can reuse this text, or can be defined separately.
    * Doors: <<doors,Describe each door as seen from the outside>>.
8.  Click **Create** and the room will be created for you.


[[doors]]
.Describing Doors
****
When registering a room, you provide descriptions for at least 4 doors.
Describe each door as it would appear from outside the room.

.Your room is in green. Describe doors as seen by the navigating player.

For example, the doors of First Room all have friendly faces on them somewhere.
If you pretend, in the diagram above, that the green room is First Room, the
person walking East saw the following when listing `/exits`:

    (E)ast  A polished wooden door with an inlaid friendly face

If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it; describe each door
without referencing a direction, and things will be fine.

== Hello, World!

Once the room is set up and it has registered with Game On!, it will be accessible
as a room in the game.

1. If you aren't in The First Room, use `/sos` to return there.
2. Use the Game On! command `/listmyrooms` from The First Room, to see your list
   of rooms. Your newly registered room should appear in that list.
3. Use the `/teleport` command to go directly to your room from The First Room to
   see it in action.

Congratulations, you've deployed a microservice that extended an
existing microservices-based application so that it can do something new!
