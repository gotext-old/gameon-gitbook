Where we learn about how to add items to your room.

## Overview

This adventure teaches you about adding virtual items to your room in Game On, taking you through understanding the required
parts of the protocol and some ideas on how to handle commands.
You learn how to have items show up in your Room Description and how to support simple commands that interact with them.

## Why Virtual Items?

Game On presents itself to users as a text-based adventure game. Within text adventures, the concepts of items and inventory are common.
The classic `/take sword` and `/kill dragon with sword` are great examples of how to make a room feel more like an interactive
experience and less like a technology demonstration.

For example, when you visit RecRoom in Game On (`/sos`, `/teleport RecRoom`), you see how it uses items to construct a puzzle that
keep users in the room entertained. Items in rooms are used in many ways, you could have them represent remote
services, or just be a signpost with instructions for how to interact with your room.

In this adventure, we add a `Button` to the room and have it respond when the user pushes it.

## Prerequisites

This adventure doesn't require any prerequisites and may be applied directly to the {sampleroom}[Sample Room].

## Walkthrough

#### Protocol

Game On Rooms support the concepts of 'items' via the websocket protocol. This means there is a difference between
sending a Room Description that has the items embedded in the description text..

[This is an odd room, the walls are covered in shelves, most of which are empty, except one. There is a pair of shoes here]

And a description that leaves them out and declares them to the room via the protocol..

[This is an odd room, the walls are covered in shelves, most of which are empty, except one.]

To understand how to do this, we need to look at the {protocol}[Game On Websocket Protocol]..

The particular message we are interested in is the {location}['location'] message, which carries the Room Description and other information back to Game On. It is this "other information" that we use to tell the game about items in the room.

The location message is documented like this:

[source,json]
player,<playerId>,{
    "type": "location",
    "name": "Room name",
    "fullName": "Room's descriptive full name",
    "description": "Lots of text about what the room looks like",
    "exits": {
        "shortDirection" : "currentDescription for Player",
        "N" :  "a dark entranceway"
    },
    "commands": {
        "/custom" : "Description of what command does"
    },
    "roomInventory": ["itemA","itemB"]
}

At the end is the "roomInventory" field which is used to pass an Array of Strings that represent the items in the room.
When the game renders the list in the web interface, it looks similar to this:

[source,text]
----
Room's descriptive full name
----------------------------
Lots of text about what the room looks like

You notice:
o itemA
o itemB
----

The `itemA`, and `itemB` have been called out by the the game's web interface, because they were present in the `roomInventory` part
of the location message from the Room.

TIP: Use unique names for the items in your room to more easily identify them. In real code, `itemA` and `itemB` might get a little confusing, thus consider the challenges of having to tell the difference between `coffee` and `coffee machine`.

#### Java Sample Room

Within the sample room, the `location` message is built from details in the {roomDescription}[RoomDescription] object, by the
{roomImplementation}[RoomImplementation] object, using the {message}[Message] object's utility method `createLocationMessage`.

Here we see the method `createLocationMessage` building up the response to send..
[source,java]
----
public static Message createLocationMessage(String userId, RoomDescription roomDescription) {

    JsonObjectBuilder payload = Json.createObjectBuilder();
    payload.add(TYPE, "location");
    payload.add("name", roomDescription.getName());
    payload.add("fullName", roomDescription.getFullName());
    payload.add("description", roomDescription.getDescription());

    // convert map of commands into JsonObject
    JsonObject commands = roomDescription.getCommands();
    if ( !commands.isEmpty()) {
        payload.add("commands", commands);
    }

    // Convert list of items into json array
    JsonArray inventory = roomDescription.getInventory();
    if ( !inventory.isEmpty()) {
        payload.add("roomInventory", inventory);
    }

    return new Message(Target.player, userId, payload.build().toString());
}
----

We see that the `location` message is built as JSON and the items are being read from the {roomDescription}[RoomDescription]
object passed as an argument.

NOTE: The `roomInventory` field is only added when there are actually items to send. By default the sample room has none.

The {roomDescription}[RoomDescription] object offers the methods
[source,java]
----
   public void addItem(String itemName);
   public void removeItem(String itemName);
   public JsonArray getInventory();
----

Which would allow a Room implementation to add/remove items from the room, and thus from the description returned to the user.

TIP: The room item response as JSON is cached by the RoomDescription object, notice how in the getInventory method, the `arr` array is only built if `itemObj' is null.

Over in the {roomImplementation}[RoomImplementation] we see the simple `processCommand` method, that parses the input from the user
and carries out the appropriate action. In this case, we're interested in the `/look` command, which should trigger a `location` response.

Sure enough, there within the switch statement, we see a location message being built & returned to the user.

[source,java]
----
  case "/look":
  case "/examine":
      // See RoomCommandsTest#testHandle*Look*

      // Treat look and examine the same (though you could make them do different things)
      if ( remainder == null || remainder.contains("room") ) {
          // This is looking at or examining the entire room. Send the player location message,
          // which includes the room description and inventory
          endpoint.sendMessage(session, Message.createLocationMessage(userId, roomDescription));
      } else {
          endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                  Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, LOOK_UNKNOWN));
      }
      break;
----

If we wanted to add additional behavior, perhaps to support `/examine itemName`, this is where we could add it. Either as an extension
to the switch block handling `/examine` and `/look`, or via an entirely new command. If the item were a button, we might like to add
`/push button` as a command and send an appropriate response.

Let's look at adding that button now.

#### Adding our own item.

Firstly, find the `postConstruct` method in the {roomImplementation}[roomImplementation], and before the last log statement, add..

[source,java]
roomDescription.addItem("button");

Then locate the switch statement within the `processCommand` method. Add a little code so that the 'else' block in the `/look` and `/examine` case, that used to look like:

.Existing Sample Code
[source,java]
----
  } else {
      endpoint.sendMessage(session,
              Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, LOOK_UNKNOWN));
  }
----

is updated to look like:

.Replaced Sample Code
[source,java]
----
  } else {
      if(remainder.contains("button"){
          endpoint.sendMessage(session,
              Message.createBroadcastEvent(username+" examines the button",
                              userId, "It's a big red button, you are very tempted to..."));
      }else{
          endpoint.sendMessage(session,
              Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, LOOK_UNKNOWN));
      }
  }
----

Finally, lets add a little code to handle the `/push` command for our button.
Go back to that `postConstruct` method, and below your `addItem("button")` line add:

[source,java]
----
roomDescription.addCommand("/push","Pushes an item, like, a button?");
----

That causes the room description to add our custom command to the `location` response, so any user doing `/help` in the room will
see `/push` described as a command.

Now, back in the switch statement within the `processCommand` method, add a new switch block that looks like...

[source,java]
----
case "/push":
    // Handle the push command, response depends if user pushes button, or anything else.
    if ( remainder.contains("button") ) {
            endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                Message.createBroadcastEvent(username+" pushes the button. Nothing Happens. Surprising.",
                                              userId, "You push the big red button."));

    } else {
        endpoint.sendMessage(session, Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, "What do you want to push?));
    }
    break;
----

That bit is invoked when the first word of the input is `/push` with the remainder set to whatever the rest of the command was.
If the user did `/push button` or `/push the button` etc, we'll send them a message saying they pushed the button and send
everyone else a message saying Nothing Happened. If the user only does `/push` by itself, we prompt them they should probably
say what they want to push.

## Suggested extensions

* Add a novelty 'mystical fortune telling ball' that gives random fortunes when shaken.
* The parsing approach here is crude, consider how you could design a framework to support multiple items, each offering their
own commands, and help text, and having an effect.
* Could you add/remove an item to the room dynamically at runtime? (remember the caching in RoomDescription)
** Perhaps via new `/additem` and `/removeitem` commands?
** Perhaps an object that appears based on the name of the player joining the room ?

## Conclusion

Items and commands are important parts of the Game On protocol and are designed to improve the end user experience with your room.
You should now have a general understanding of the steps required to add items and handle them with commands.
