== Prerequisites for Bluemix deployment

- https://console.ng.bluemix.net[Bluemix account] / https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/admin/account.html[Signing up for Bluemix]
- https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/[Cloud Foundry command line]

== Create Bluemix account

If you already have a Bluemix account, you can skip right over this section.

Sign up for Bluemix at https://console.ng.bluemix.net
When you sign up, you'll create an IBM ID, create an alias, and
register with Bluemix.

* Make a note of your username and org, as you will need both later.
  - By default, the space is `dev` and the org is the project creator's user name.
    For example, if sara@example.com signs in to Bluemix for the first time,
    the active space is `dev` and the org is `sara@example.com`.

* Make a note of your region! (US South, United Kingdom, or Australia)
  - When you log into Bluemix, your logged in username, organization, and
    space are shown in the top right. If you click in the top right corner,
    you'll see the region displayed in the panel displayed on the right side
    of the screen.

== Log in using the `cf` command

Login to Bluemix via the command line: `cf login`
- Enter Bluemix API endpoint (for your region):
  * US South: `https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
  * London: `https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net`
- Enter email and password for Bluemix login
- Enter the Bluemix organization
- Enter the Bluemix space

== Deploying the app

1. `cf push <cf-app-name> -p <app archive>`
  - Choose a unique app name. This will be used as the first part of the URL, e.g. `cf-app-name` becomes `cf-app-name.mybluemix.net`
  - For `sample-room-java`, the app archive is `target/gameon-room-java.zip`
  - https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#dep_apps[Deploying applications by using the cf command]

2. After your room has been pushed, you should be able to view it at:
  - US South: `http://<cf-app-name>.mybluemix.net/`
  - United Kingdom: `http://<cf-app-name>.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/`
