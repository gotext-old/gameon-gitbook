Where we learn about Persistence via Cloudant.

## Overview

This adventure will take you through the basics of Persistence from a Microservice perspective, using Cloudant
as your backing database. You will add simple usage of Cloudant to a Game On room, and will learn about configuring
a Cloudant service instance, communicating with it, and how you might use this further within a room.

## Why Cloudant ?

There are many options for persistence in a microservices architecture, including nosql db's, graph db's, and regular
sql db's. In this walkthrough we'll just be looking at one, Cloudant. Cloudant describes itself as:

[quote]
"...a fully-managed database service built to scale globally,
run non-stop, and handle flexible schemas for rapid development. Just PUT JSON in and GET JSON out."

It has a REST based interface and uses JSON as its records. Which makes for nice, simple integration with most
microservice projects, although remember that just because we're choosing Cloudant for this Room service,
{microserviceowndb}[it doesn't mean all of your services have to!]

Being able to store documents in this manner isn't just something you might want for a room, the Game On Player
service, and the Map service both use Cloudant to persist their data.

We'll extend the Java Sample Room, to add a way for users in the room to select items from a vending
machine, and have the room modify `/examine` to show the item the user has equipped. We'll store the
selection for a player in Cloudant, and query the stored data to handle the `/examine` command for a player.

## Prerequisites

This walkthrough starts after having completed the {sample-room-java}[Java Sample Room].

It requires a Cloudant service for your room to talk to, you can acquire one for free
in Bluemix by;

1. Signing into the Bluemix web console.
2. Select `Services` from the "_Hamburger_" Menu. (or cheat, and use the link in the next step.)
3. Click the `Catalog` link to go to the view of {servicecatalog}[available services in Bluemix].
4. Search for, or navigate to {cloudantservice}[`Cloudant NoSQL DB`]
5. Goto the Cloudant service page, scroll down, and ensure you select the ``'Lite'`` (Free) tier.
+
TIP: Notice the free tier has restrictions not just on how much data you store, but also how
often you can perform lookups, writes, and queries.

6. In the `Connect to:` drop down on the left, find and select your Java Sample Room.
7. Give the Service name/Credential name something meaningful that you'll recognise later.
8. Hit the 'Create' button at the bottom right.

TIP: If you already have a Cloudant service in bluemix, you may use it rather than creating another.
But *you* need to be able to understand the implications for any data already in that service.

Congratulations, you've created a Cloudant instance that we'll use in the rest of this walkthrough.

## Walkthrough

### Pom.xml updates to add the Cloudant client.

Firstly, edit the `pom.xml` in your room project and find the `<dependencies>...</dependencies>` block.
Add this dependency after the existing ones, just before the `</dependencies>`
tag.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.cloudant</groupId>
    <artifactId>cloudant-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.8.0</version>
</dependency>
----

This will allow us to use the Cloudant client library within our Room code.

### Parsing VCAP_SERVICES to obtain the service details.

When our Room is running as a CF App in bluemix, we'll be supplied the details for our Cloudant instance
as part of the environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES`. This happens because we attached the service to our
Java Room app in step 6 in the Prerequisites section.

To retrieve the service details we need to parse the JSON supplied in this environment var, and extract
the Cloudant specific information.

As documented over on the {cloudantstarter}['Getting started with Cloudant'] page, the JSON will have structure like this:
[source, json]
----
{
    "cloudantNoSQLDB": {
        "name": "Cloudant-3s",
        "label": "cloudantNoSQLDB",
        "plan": "shared",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "someusername",
            "password": "secret",
            "host": "myhost-bluemix.cloudant.com",
            "port": 443,
            "url": "https://someusername:secret@myhost-bluemix.cloudant.com"
        }
    }
}
----

Lets start by processing that using `javax.json` package. In the `RoomImplementation`
class, add the following code to the `postConstruct` method.

[source,java]
----
  String vcapServicesEnv = System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES");
  if (vcapServicesEnv == null) {
      throw new RuntimeException("VCAP_SERVICES was not set, are we running in Bluemix?");
  }
  JsonObject vcapServices = Json.createReader(
                              new StringReader(vcapServicesEnv)).readObject();
  JsonArray serviceObjectArray = vcapServices.getJsonArray("cloudantNoSQLDB");
  JsonObject serviceObject = serviceObjectArray.getJsonObject(0);
  JsonObject credentials = serviceObject.getJsonObject("credentials");
  String username = credentials.getJsonString("username").getString();
  String password = credentials.getJsonString("password").getString();
  String url = credentials.getJsonString("url").getString();
----

That will read the JSON, and dive down to obtain the credentials, and then the username, password,
and url we need.

### Connecting to the database

Now we have the credentials, and URL, we need to create a `CloudantClient` that will let us
talk to the service.

[source,java]
----
CloudantClient client = ClientBuilder.url(url)
            .username(username)
            .password(password)
            .build();
----

Now lets obtain an object that lets us talk to our database inside our Cloudant Service.
First declare the `db` object as a class variable so we can refer to it later.

Add this to `RoomImplementation` up near where `roomDescription` is defined.

[source,java]
----
private Database db;
----

Then initialise it within the `postConstruct` method after your have built the
`CloudandClient`.

[source,java]
----
db = client.database("Shoes",true);
----

This will obtain the database called `Shoes`, and if it doesn't exist, it will create it. That's great,
because at this point we know it doesn't exist yet, but once it does, we can keep using the same
code to obtain it regardless.


TIP: if you are using a pre-existing Cloudant service, here you can use a unique db name that won't
clash with any other data you have stored.

### Creating a simple item selection machine in Game On.

We take a quick twisty road away from persistence for a moment, because we need something to persist.

Lets create ourselves an imaginary machine that the player can use to pick a pair of shoes. To keep
this walkthrough brief, we'll limit the machine to existing via custom commands, but if you follow
the 'Adding items to your room' tutorial, you can easily make it into a real Game On room item.

First we'll add some shoes for our machine to stock.. in the `RoomImplementation` class, add
a class variable declaration like this:

[source,java]
----
final static String shoes[][] = {
   {"Red Stilettos", "a beautiful pair of red stiletto heels."},
   {"Pink GoGo Boots", "a shockingly high platformed pair of gogo boots."},
   {"Green Strappy Sandals", "a curious combination seemingly held together by"+
                             " many tiny buckles."},
   {"Blue Wedge Heels", "a deep blue pair of very high wedge heels."},
   {"Black Oxfords", "a dull boring pair of oxfords, with a 5 inch heel."}
};
----

We'll use the primary index to know which pair we are talking about, and the secondary to
obtain details about the shoes. We'll try to keep the descriptions so that we can add them to
text based on the template ``"<PlayerName> is wearing"``.

Find the `processCommand` method in the `RoomImplementation` class. It's main logic is comprised of a
switch statement that compares the command the user entered, with the commands the room understands.
Add a block to that switch statement that looks like the following:

[source,java]
----
case "/listshoes" :
    StringBuilder resp = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("There are the following shoes available;\n");
    for(String[] shoe in shoes){
      sb.append("* \"");
      sb.append(shoe[0]);
      sb.append("\" - \"");
      sb.append(shoe[1]);
      sb.append("\"");
    }
    endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                       Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                       resp.toString()));
    break;
----

Thats enough to allow our users to discover our shoes, now lets allow them to equip a pair.

[source,java]
----
case "/equip" :
  if(remainder == null){
  endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                       Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                       "Equip what? maybe try /listshoes, and pick a pair"));
  }
    for(String[] shoe in shoes){
      if(shoe[0].toLowerCase().equals(remainder)){
        endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                             Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                             "You are now wearing "+shoe[1]));
  		return;
  	}
  }
  //no match
  endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                       Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                       "I couldn't find "+remainder+" to equip."+
                       " Maybe try /listshoes, and pick a pair")););
  break;
----

And thats enough to allow a player do do `/equip red stilettos` and have an appropriate
response go back. Of course, we know this, but the room user doesn't yet, we could
update our RoomDescription to include information on our new command. Take a look at
the {addingitems}[Adding items to your room] adventure to find out more.

So far, the room is still stateless, although we've allowed the user to pick from
a list of shoes, and told them they are now wearing them, we forgot we did that as soon
as we sent them the message.

Effectively that's as far as you can get without some sort of persistence. Next
we'll look at saving the choices to the database.

### Tracking the equipped item via the database.

Before we can put things into, and get things out of, the database we need to
decide on what 'things' are. Cloudant will store JSON objects, and the Cloudant
client API we are using will automatically map these to & from Java bean type
objects.

So first we should create a class representing the data we plan to store and
retrieve from the database. We could just store the players userId and an
index into the shoes array, but that would be fragile if the array changed
and could lead to someone wearing the wrong shoes! Instead, we will store the
players userId and the name and description for the shoes they chose. That
way if we change the shoes in the machine, they will always get to keep the
version they had.

NOTE: There are obviously many ways to crack this particular nut, and we're not
trying to make any statement here about the suitability of the one we've chosen
beyond that it works well for the purpose of this tutorial. One of the suggested
extensions to this adventure is to improve the way the items are stored =)

Here's our example class:

[source,java]
----
public class PlayerData {
  private String _id;
  private String _rev;
  private String shoeName = null;
  private String shoeDesc = null;

  public Player() {
    shoeName = "";
    shoeDesc = "";
  }

  public String get_id() { return _id;	}
  public void set_id(String _id) { this._id = _id; }

  public String get_rev() {	return _rev;}
  public void set_rev(String _rev) { this._rev = _rev; }

  public String getShoeName() { return shoeName; }
  public void setShoeName(String shoeName) { this.shoeName = shoeName; }

  public String getShoeDesc() { return shoeDesc; }
  public void setShoeDesc(String shoeDesc) { this.shoeDesc = shoeDesc; }

}
----

Here we see pretty much what we'd expect, a class with getters/setters for the
Shoe Name & Shoe Description. Notice also the 2 extra fields `_id` and `_rev`
which {cloudantfields}[form part of how Cloudant remembers the data]. We'll
use the `_id` field with the userId we have for the player.


Now lets edit our `/equip` method to store/update the choice in the database.

[source,java]
----
case "/equip" :
  if(remainder == null){
    endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                         Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                         "Equip what? maybe try /listshoes, and pick a pair"));
  }
  for(String[] shoe in shoes){
    if(shoe[0].toLowerCase().equals(remainder)){
      endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                           Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                           "You are now wearing "+shoe[1]));

      PlayerData pd = new PlayerData();
      pd.set_id(userId);
      pd.setShoeName(shoe[0]);
      pd.setShoeDesc(shoe[1]);
      db.post(pd);

      return;
    }
  }
  //no match
  endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                       Message.createSpecificEvent(userId,
                       "I couldn't find "+remainder+" to equip."+
                       " Maybe try /listshoes, and pick a pair")););
  break;
----

When a player uses `/equip` now, we will push the details of their selected
shoe choice to the database. Now let's see about reading it back...

### Querying the db for `/examine` command

We will update the `/examine` command so that if a player issues `/examine <playername>`
that we will will return the message `<playername> is wearing <shoedesc>`. If we
have no database entry for the player, we'll just return a fixed message.

Our first minor problem to solve is that our `PlayerData` is indexed by player
id, but the players in the room will be using username to refer to each other.
So we need a way to track the username to player id mappings active in our room.

Head up to where `roomDescription` is declared in `RoomImplementation` and add
a quick HashMap that we'll use to store that data.

[source,java]
----
private Map<String,String> nameToId = new ConcurrentHashMap<String,String>();
----

[NOTE]
====
In this example, we are pretending that player names are unique. They are
*not*. Player Ids however, *are* unique. To deal with that correctly within a Room would
require code that would otherwise distract from the use of Cloudant we're trying
to cover here.

To handle this properly you need to effectively build a way to
distinguish 2 players using the same name within your room, and track if the player
changes their name while in your room.

For the most part, names are unique enough to get away with what we're doing here, especially
for an example, so don't worry too much!!
====

Locate the `handleMessage` method of the `RoomImplementation` class, and just after
the `userId` and `username` fields have been declared, add:

[source,java]
----
nameToId.put(username.toLowerCase(),userId);
----

That will update the map every time we receive a message. We can then track when
players leave by adding this to the `roomPart` and `roomGoodbye` blocks:

[source,java]
----
nameToId.remove(username.toLowerCase());
----

TIP: Consider using a JSR-107 Cache, rather than a Map, to store the id->name relationship.
That way if your room is scaled up to multiple instances under load, they will all
share a consistent view of the players "in the room". Find out more in the
{jsr107aa}[JSR-107 Caching Walkthrough].

Now we have a way to map from player name to player id, we can update our
`/examine` command to allow `/examine playername`.

Find the `/look` and `/examine` case statement in the `processCommand` method
in the `RoomImplementation` class. Update it to look like this:

[source,java]
----
case "/look":
case "/examine":
    if ( remainder == null || remainder.contains("room") ) {
        endpoint.sendMessage(session, Message.createLocationMessage(userId, roomDescription));
    } else {
        String targetId = namesToId.get(remainder);
        if(targetId!=null){
          PlayerData pd = db.find(PlayerData.class,targetId);
          if(pd!=null){
            endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                  Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, remainder
                     +" is wearing "+pd.getShoeDesc()));
          }else{
            endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                  Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, remainder
                     +" does not seem to be wearing any shoes at the moment."));
          }
        }else{
          endpoint.sendMessage(session,
                Message.createSpecificEvent(userId, LOOK_UNKNOWN));
        }
    }
    break;
----

Great, now when a player does `/examine fred` we'll check if we know the player
id for fred (which we should do, if fred is in our room), and then we'll look
in the database to see if fred has `/equip` 'd a pair of shoes.

## Suggested extensions

* Store the item descriptions themselves in the db
* Use the database to store id's of users trusted to add items to the vending machine
** Add commands to allow trusted users to update the machine content
* Update the db to allow players to own more than 1 pair of shoes
** Use Cloudant to locate the equipped pair for a player using a filtered query
** Allow players to trade shoes with each other

## Conclusion

You have now learned a little about how to talk to Cloudant, and use it to persist
data from your Microservice. Although here the example is just for fun, you can
hopefully see how you could apply the same approach for more serious data within
a service. For a discussion of how the Game On Map service uses Cloudant, have a look
{map}[here].

## Suggested further adventures.

Consider taking a look at the JSR-107 adventure, it would be interesting to store
active items in a Cache, and prepopulate the cache from the db. You could also investigate
the JSR-107 Write-through behavior to keep the db up to date with cache changes.

Or maybe take a look at the Adding items to your room adventure, and learn how you
could turn the vending machine, and the items the player obtains from it, into proper
Game On entities.
